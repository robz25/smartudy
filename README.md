Welcome to Smartudy. It is a project to learn with your style. The working group is formed by Robin Gonzalez and Alisson Navarro, technology learners who put hands on action. 




## THE IDEA

A learning platform that leverages artificial intelligence to streamline the development of study materials. 

#How Smartudy reimagine the Future of Education?
Smartudy includes the extraction of succinct text summaries from various text sources or files, enhancing the accessibility and comprehensibility of the content.
In addition, the platform features audio generation capabilities, catering to diverse learning styles and promoting inclusivity. 
This innovative approach enriches the learning experience by delivering tailored educational resources, thereby accommodating individual learning preferences and needs.

It is important to pay attention to learning styles, and 89% of teachers believe in matching instruction to a student’s preferred learning style, so we need to empower 65% of people who are visual learners and 30% who learn by listening. 

## How Smartudy uses Azure AI?
Smartudy is based on Azure Cognitive Services in Azure AI features using Vision, Language and Speeech capabilities to convert manual notes of files from students to text, create text summaries and convert text to audio. 

Now we are going to try our Demo.
